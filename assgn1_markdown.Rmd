## ESM237 Assignment #1

### Introduction.

Santa Cruz is a coastal town located on the Northern edge of the Monterey Bay in California. It is largely urban, but is surrounded by coastline to the South, wooded hills to the North and East, and smaller neighboring towns. The climate is temperate and Mediterranean, with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Summers are foggy, providing moisture for coastal redwood forests and other local ecosystems. The economy is Santa Cruz is partially dependent on tourism brought in by the natural resources, including beaches, word-class surfing, mountain biking, and hiking. The surrounding communities rely heavily on agriculture. The water supply for the City comes from mostly from a local reservoir that relies on local precipitation, but is also supplemented by a few wells and some small creeks. 

![Figure 1. Map of Monterey Bay highlighting location of Santa Cruz County (left) and map of California to show location within the state.](scz_map.jpg)

As the climate changes, some important impacts include changing precipitation amounts affecting rainfall, agriculture, and flooding; increased temperatures causing ecosystem harm, higher fire danger, and changing human behavior; and sea level rise which can cause coastal flooding and cliff erosion.

### Climate trends.

I conducted an analysis of one long-term climate dataset for Santa Cruz (Station name: SANTA CRUZ, CA US
; Network:ID GHCND:USC00047916) from [NOAA NCEI CDO](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/findstation) looking at temperature and precipitation trends from 1920 to 2019. In this report I will explore trends over this time period in average daily temperature, average yearly rainfall, and annual temperature extremes.

### Discussion.

Average temperatures:

Based on this dataset, the average daily temperature aggregated over the entire year is increasing slightly over the 100 year time period, at a rate of, on average, about .02 degrees per year (figure 1). This is significant over time, as that equates to about 1 degree Farenheit of warming every 50 years, on average. If this trend continues into the future in the same way, this slight increase in air temperature could have effects on Santa Cruz. The warmer temperatures could change growing seasons, and crop yields in the agricultural sector. Increased evaporation could leave vegetated areas drier and more vulnerable to fire in the dry season, and could put strain on water resources for landscaping and in reservoirs. More in depth analysis could reveal information about timing of the onset of seasonality and other important factors.

Annual Precipitation:

This data suggests that while the annual rainfall appears to be decreased very slightly over the 100 year time period, it is not likely a trend outside of expected variability. This is important to note, because at this point there is no indication that climate has altered rainfall, based on the data trends. Even when the time span is split into the last 50 years, there is no apparent trend in the total amount of annual rainfall. Within this data, it is important to note that there is still year to year variability in the rainfall, and even looking further, there are no obvious trends for each month, looking over the 100 year time span (Figure 7). This information can be used to create water management plans looking into the future for residents, commercial businesses, and the agricultural sector. Perhaps there have been even more recent trends than the last 50 years, but that would be difficult to measure with a small sample considering the variability in year to year rainfall in the background data.

Precipitation changes in the area can have multiple effects. While unlikely to affect sea level, precipitation can incerase runoff from land and nutrient inputs into coastal ocean waters, leading to poor water quality and algal blooms. Coastal erosion may also be increased with added runoff and storm swells. For residents, changes in precipitation will affect water supply and usage, especially decreased precipitation, since the water supply is dependent on rain in the local reservoir. Water availability also impacts businesses and agriculture, especially if water availability decreases and the available supply must then be rationed between all of the local demand. 

Maximum annual temperature:

The maximum annual temperature does not appear to increase significantly over the long term (figure 5), but looking over the last 28 years, actually shows a more dramatic increasing trend. A linear regression model estimates that the number of days over 85 degrees has increased by 0.5446 per year, p=0.00767. This makes sense because while the last 100 years of temperature data provides an excellent baseline, the changes in climate that are being felt in the area would be more recent. However, it is also difficult to attribute trends in the shorter timescales to long term climate change, versus shorter term variation. This is an important factor to consider because more hot days can have a significant impact on many sectors. Being a relatively temperate location, many people do not have air conditioning systems in their houses, and more hot days could drive installation of these systems, adding extra draw on the electrical grid in Summer and Fall. Plants and crops may require more water, and some may experience excess temperature stress and be unable to survive, especially in the case that this trend continues into the future. 


Minimum annual temperature:

Based on my analysis, there appears to be a trend in the last 100 years of the minimum annual temperatures increasing over time (figure 6). From a linear regression, the minimum annual temperature is increasing by an average of 0.03595 degrees per year, p=0.000544. This data is important to consider especially for ecosystem health and for agriculture. Although currently temperatures reach below freezing less frequently than they did previously, based on a linear regression year with p=3.47e-06. This suggests that, although changes to maximum temperature are not apparent, with increasing average temperatures, minimum temperatures are increasing as well. Warmer minimum air temperatures may affect sea surface temperatures, soil temperatures, and other surfaces that would normally cool more during the coldest times of the year. Although not lkely to have large effects in the short term, this trend can continue into the future and have larger effects.
